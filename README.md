# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

For my final project, I want to create a simple Eventbrite-crowdfunding solution for events. Users can commit their assets to contribute towards an event and if the event attains the required amount, the smart contract executes and mints "event tokens" (could be NFTs) to represent ownership/access to the event. Owners of these event tokens can choose to auction or sell off these tokens to others who want to attend the event.
